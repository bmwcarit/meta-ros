## History

The original implementation of `meta-ros` for ROS 1 Indigo Igloo
(<https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros>) was transferred here on 2019-06-25. It
has been converted to use recipes generated by
[superflore](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/superflore/). Please see this
[wiki page](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Superflore-OE-Recipe-Generation-Scheme)
for details of what was done and the current development milestones.

The original implementation has been retained in the
[`legacy`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/legacy) branch.
