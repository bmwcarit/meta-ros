# Branch `[thud]` (UNSUPPORTED)

The **thud** OpenEmbedded release series has reached its EOL (see
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases). Support for ROS distro releases
newer than those of Milestone 13 (2020-07-04) has not been added to this branch,
and, following the
[OpenEmbedded Release Series Support Policy](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Policies#openembedded-release-series-support),
building with **thud** is no longer supported as of Milestone 15 (2020-12-23).

Instructions for using `meta-ros` are
[here](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions).


## History

The original implementation of `meta-ros` for ROS 1 Indigo Igloo
(<https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros>) was transferred here on 2019-06-25. It
has been converted to use recipes generated by
[superflore](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/superflore/). Please see this
[wiki page](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Superflore-OE-Recipe-Generation-Scheme)
for details of what was done and the current development milestones.

The original implementation has been retained in the
[`legacy`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/legacy) branch.
