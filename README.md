# Branch `[zeus]` (REDUCED SUPPORT)

The Support Level of the **zeus** OpenEmbedded release series is now
**Community** (see https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases). Following the
[OpenEmbedded Release Series Support Policy](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Policies#openembedded-release-series-support),
support for ROS distro releases newer than those of Milestone 13 (2020-07-04)
has not been added to this branch, and, as of Milestone 15 (2020-12-23), only a
"best effort" is being made to keep the releases of **melodic**, **dashing**,
and **foxy** from Milestone 13 buildable with it.

Instructions for using `meta-ros` are
[here](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions).


## History

The original implementation of `meta-ros` for ROS 1 Indigo Igloo
(<https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros>) was transferred here on 2019-06-25. It
has been converted to use recipes generated by
[superflore](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/superflore/). Please see this
[wiki page](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Superflore-OE-Recipe-Generation-Scheme)
for details of what was done and the current development milestones.

The original implementation has been retained in the
[`legacy`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/legacy) branch.
