# Branch `[dunfell]`

As of Milestone 15 (2020-12-23), this branch can be used to build the releases
current at the beginning of November 2020 of ROS 2 **dashing**, **eloquent**,
**foxy**, and **rolling** and ROS 1 **melodic** with the **dunfell**
OpenEmbedded release series.

Instructions for using `meta-ros` are

## History

The original implementation of `meta-ros` for ROS 1 Indigo Igloo
(<https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros>) was transferred here on 2019-06-25. It
has been converted to use recipes generated by
[superflore](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/superflore/). Please see this
[wiki page](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Superflore-OE-Recipe-Generation-Scheme)
for details of what was done and the current development milestones.

The original implementation has been retained in the
[`legacy`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/legacy) branch.
