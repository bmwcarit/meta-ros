This is a layer to provide ROS Hydromedusa in an OpenEmbedded Linux system.
Currently, this layer is still under development and only provides 
cross-compilation of the basic ros-comm packages.

INSTALLATION

  The repository contains a layer for ROS that builds on top of the
  OpenEmbedded Core layer and the meta-oe layer.

  We believe it should work with the current HEAD of the layers mentioned above.
  As a further reference, here are the version I currently work with:
    * commit 395b90054eccddc1c9062a9a8657ed4482b7710a of https://github.com/openembedded/oe-core
    * commit 2a5dea2399e2be5e5d964eda7465dcaf4c2e152b of https://github.com/openembedded/meta-oe
    * commit 324ed96e28ec31cff8cef1824d20d40f9a5d46ad of git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake in the bitbake directory


USAGE

  Currently, you can cross-compile the ROS packages with the commands:
    source oe-init-build-env
    bitbake <package-name>

  Look at the meta-ros test reports for the description of the current state.

  The recipe core-image-ros-roscore provides a minimal Linux system that runs
  roscore.

  You can compile the minimal Linux system with
    bitbake core-image-ros-roscore

  Then for example, you start this system in the qemu virtual machine with
    runqemu <MACHINE> core-image-ros-roscore

  
  On the Linux system, ensure that the own host's name in resolved by adding
  
    127.0.0.1	<HOSTNAME>.localdomain		<HOSTNAME>

  to the /etc/hosts file, and set up the environment with

    export ROS_ROOT=/usr
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr
    touch /usr/.catkin

  Finally, you can start roscore with
    roscore
